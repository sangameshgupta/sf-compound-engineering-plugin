description: "Write or refresh a value-first PR description for a Salesforce branch or PR. Use when the user says 'write a PR description', 'refresh the PR description', 'describe this Apex change', 'document this metadata bundle', 'rewrite this PR'. Highlights Salesforce scope: Apex/LWC/Flow/metadata included, deploy targets, Apex test coverage delta, governor-limit risks, and required post-deploy steps."

# sf-pr-description

Generate a Salesforce-aware pull request description that scales with change complexity: a focused trigger fix gets a short body; a metadata bundle plus Apex plus LWC plus permission changes gets sectioned with deploy plan and post-deploy verification.

<feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</feature_description>

## Salesforce Angle

- **Scope summary**: explicit list of file types touched (`force-app/main/default/classes/`, `lwc/`, `flows/`, `objects/`, `permissionsets/`, `profiles/`).
- **Deploy plan**: target environment(s), validate vs. quick-deploy, dependencies on prior deploys, package.xml or destructive changes.
- **Test plan**: Apex test classes affected, coverage delta, sharing scenarios exercised, mock callouts, manual UI verification needs.
- **Risk callouts**: governor-limit headroom changes, sharing/visibility changes, integration contract changes, permission set delta.

## Interaction Method

When asking the user a question, use the platform's blocking question tool (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini). Fall back to numbered options in chat when no blocking tool is available. Ask one question at a time. Prefer concise single-select choices when natural options exist.

## Procedure

This skill follows the standard sf-compound-engineering execution discipline:

1. **Understand the input** — read the `<feature_description>` block above and any referenced files, plans, or issues.
2. **Plan a small set of phases** — break the work into 2-5 ordered steps that an implementer (or another skill) can verify.
3. **Apply the Salesforce Angle notes above** — these encode the platform-specific considerations (governor limits, sharing context, deploy ordering, FLS, metadata semantics) that distinguish this skill from generic counterparts.
4. **Use Salesforce-aware contexts and commands** — file paths under `force-app/main/default/...`, test commands like `sf apex run test`, deploy commands like `sf project deploy validate` and `sf project deploy start`, query the org with `sf data query` when state inspection is needed.
5. **Surface decisions back to the user** — when a step requires a choice that materially affects scope or risk, ask using the platform's blocking question tool rather than guessing.
