description: "Build Salesforce systems where any user action through Setup, the IDE, or `sf` CLI is also accessible to a Salesforce-aware agent. Use when designing automation, MCP tools, hosted MCP servers, or features that should be operable by both humans and agents. Trigger phrases: 'design this for an agent', 'agent-native this Salesforce feature'."

# sf-agent-native-architecture

Apply agent-native design principles to Salesforce features: every human-affordance has an agent-affordance.

<feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</feature_description>

## Salesforce Angle

- Setup actions → Metadata API + Tooling API + sf CLI equivalents.
- UI buttons → Flow `Action` or Apex `@InvocableMethod` exposed via Hosted MCP server.
- Custom field changes → Tooling API CustomField operations.
- Reports → Reports REST API.

## Interaction Method

When asking the user a question, use the platform's blocking question tool (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini). Fall back to numbered options in chat when no blocking tool is available. Ask one question at a time. Prefer concise single-select choices when natural options exist.

## Procedure

This skill follows the standard sf-compound-engineering execution discipline:

1. **Understand the input** — read the `<feature_description>` block above and any referenced files, plans, or issues.
2. **Plan a small set of phases** — break the work into 2-5 ordered steps that an implementer (or another skill) can verify.
3. **Apply the Salesforce Angle notes above** — these encode the platform-specific considerations (governor limits, sharing context, deploy ordering, FLS, metadata semantics) that distinguish this skill from generic counterparts.
4. **Use Salesforce-aware contexts and commands** — file paths under `force-app/main/default/...`, test commands like `sf apex run test`, deploy commands like `sf project deploy validate` and `sf project deploy start`, query the org with `sf data query` when state inspection is needed.
5. **Surface decisions back to the user** — when a step requires a choice that materially affects scope or risk, ask using the platform's blocking question tool rather than guessing.
