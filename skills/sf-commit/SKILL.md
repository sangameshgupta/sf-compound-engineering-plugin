Use when the user says 'commit', 'commit this', 'save my Apex changes', 'create a commit'. Scopes: `apex`, `lwc`, `flow`, `metadata`, `integration`, `data`, `permset`, `profile`, `docs`, `chore`."

# sf-commit

Produce well-structured commit messages following Salesforce-flavored conventional commit format.

<feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</feature_description>

## Salesforce Angle

- Type/scope examples: `feat(apex):`, `fix(lwc):`, `feat(flow):`, `chore(metadata):`, `feat(integration):`, `fix(data):`, `chore(permset):`, `chore(profile):`.
- Don't include attribution footers in incremental commits — only on the final ship commit (per V3 ce-commit convention).
- Stage only files relevant to this logical Salesforce unit (avoid `git add -A` to prevent picking up unrelated metadata).

## Interaction Method

When asking the user a question, use the platform's blocking question tool (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini). Fall back to numbered options in chat when no blocking tool is available. Ask one question at a time. Prefer concise single-select choices when natural options exist.

## Procedure

This skill follows the standard sf-compound-engineering execution discipline:

1. **Understand the input** — read the `<feature_description>` block above and any referenced files, plans, or issues.
2. **Plan a small set of phases** — break the work into 2-5 ordered steps that an implementer (or another skill) can verify.
3. **Apply the Salesforce Angle notes above** — these encode the platform-specific considerations (governor limits, sharing context, deploy ordering, FLS, metadata semantics) that distinguish this skill from generic counterparts.
4. **Use Salesforce-aware contexts and commands** — file paths under `force-app/main/default/...`, test commands like `sf apex run test`, deploy commands like `sf project deploy validate` and `sf project deploy start`, query the org with `sf data query` when state inspection is needed.
5. **Surface decisions back to the user** — when a step requires a choice that materially affects scope or risk, ask using the platform's blocking question tool rather than guessing.
