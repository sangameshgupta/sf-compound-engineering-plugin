description: "Run metric-driven iterative optimization loops on a Salesforce target. Define a measurable goal (Apex CPU time, SOQL count, query selectivity, LWC bundle size, governor-limit headroom), build measurement scaffolding, then run experiments. Use for 'optimize this query', 'reduce SOQL count', 'speed up this trigger', 'optimize this LWC render'."

# sf-optimize

Systematic experimentation loop: measure → propose → run experiments in parallel → keep improvements → converge.

<feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</feature_description>

## Salesforce Angle

- Salesforce metrics: Apex CPU time, heap size, SOQL count, DML count, query selectivity (filterable indexes hit), LWC bundle size, p95 page load.
- Measurement scaffolding uses `Limits.getCpuTime()`, `Limits.getQueries()`, debug logs, the SOQL Query Plan tool, and the LWC Lighthouse profile.

## Interaction Method

When asking the user a question, use the platform's blocking question tool (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini). Fall back to numbered options in chat when no blocking tool is available. Ask one question at a time. Prefer concise single-select choices when natural options exist.

## Procedure

This skill follows the standard sf-compound-engineering execution discipline:

1. **Understand the input** — read the `<feature_description>` block above and any referenced files, plans, or issues.
2. **Plan a small set of phases** — break the work into 2-5 ordered steps that an implementer (or another skill) can verify.
3. **Apply the Salesforce Angle notes above** — these encode the platform-specific considerations (governor limits, sharing context, deploy ordering, FLS, metadata semantics) that distinguish this skill from generic counterparts.
4. **Use Salesforce-aware contexts and commands** — file paths under `force-app/main/default/...`, test commands like `sf apex run test`, deploy commands like `sf project deploy validate` and `sf project deploy start`, query the org with `sf data query` when state inspection is needed.
5. **Surface decisions back to the user** — when a step requires a choice that materially affects scope or risk, ask using the platform's blocking question tool rather than guessing.
