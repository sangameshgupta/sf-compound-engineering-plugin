name: sf-plan
description: "Create structured implementation plans for Salesforce features. Use when planning Apex changes, LWC components, Flow automation, integrations, metadata deployments, or any multi-step Salesforce build. Also deepen existing plans. Use when the user says 'plan this Apex feature', 'how should I build this LWC', 'plan the integration', 'break down this Salesforce requirement', 'plan a trigger refactor', 'plan the deployment', or when a brainstorm/requirements document is ready for planning. For exploratory or ambiguous requests, prefer sf-brainstorm first."
argument-hint: "[optional: feature description, requirements doc path, plan path to deepen, or Salesforce work to plan]"

# /sf-plan

> **Principles enforced:** 2 (verifiability), 4 (spec is the artifact), 7 (institutional knowledge). See `PRINCIPLES.md`.

## Copy-paste-to-agent

```
Plan a Salesforce feature without writing code. Produce three artifacts: spec.md (business
requirements + acceptance criteria), plan.md (architecture + governor/sharing/security analysis),
and tasks.md (ordered implementation checklist). Before writing the plan, dispatch
sf-learnings-researcher, sf-repo-research-analyst, sf-best-practices-researcher, and
sf-framework-docs-researcher in parallel. The plan MUST include a "Verification Strategy"
section that names the test, assertion, or dry-run that proves the feature works — no
verification, no plan. Save under docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<slug>-plan.md.

Step 5: Verification Strategy (mandatory, Principle 2)
Before the plan is considered complete, fill in a Verification Strategy section. This is the single non-negotiable section in every plan. If you cannot describe how the feature will be verified, the feature is not ready to be planned — return to spec.
The Verification Strategy section must answer all five of the following:
Acceptance assertion — What is the boolean check that proves the feature works? Express as an Apex assertion, SOQL count, Flow path, or LWC behavior. Example: assertEquals(1, [SELECT COUNT() FROM Lead WHERE Owner.Id = :territoryOwner.Id]).
Bulk threshold — At what record count is bulkification verified? For Apex, default to 200; for batch contexts, state the chunk size and the total. If bulk is not applicable (e.g., single-record UI flow), say so explicitly.
Governor boundary — Which governor limit is closest to the feature's worst case? Name it (SOQL 101, DML 150, CPU 10s, Heap 6MB, callout 100, etc.) and state the projected utilization at the verification threshold.
Sharing scenario — Under which sharing context is the feature verified? List the user profile or permission set used, and whether the feature runs with sharing, without sharing, or inherited sharing. State the expected behavior for an unprivileged user explicitly.
Integration mock or dry-run — For features with callouts, platform events, or deploy steps: name the mock class (HttpCalloutMock), the event publish assertion, or the sf project deploy start --dry-run command that proves the integration boundary works without side effects.
Verification Strategy is the gate between /sf-plan and /sf-work. /sf-lfg will refuse to advance from plan to work if any of the five fields are blank or hand-waved ("we'll add tests later" is not a verification strategy).</span>
