# SF Compound Engineering

**Instruction-Based Compound Engineering for Salesforce** — a Claude Code plugin-first workflow for Salesforce development, where each iteration becomes smarter than the last.

Inspired by [Every's Compound Engineering](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/compound-engineering-how-every-codes-with-agents) and [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).

## The Compound Engineering Loop

```
Plan (40%) → Work (20%) → Review (20%) → Compound (20%) → Repeat
     │            │             │              │
     │            │             │              └── Capture learnings to skills, agents, CLAUDE.md
     │            │             └── Review with relevant agents
     │            └── Implement following patterns from skills
     └── Research & design using relevant skills/agents
```

**Each iteration starts smarter** because learnings compound into agents, skills, and project context.

---

## Quick Start (Claude Plugin First)

```bash
# Add this repository as a plugin source
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/gellasangameshgupta/sf-compound-engineering-plugin

# Install the Salesforce plugin
/plugin install sf-compound-engineering
```

The plugin provides:
- **4 slash commands** for the compound engineering workflow
- **23 specialized agents** (apex, lwc, automation, integration, architecture)
- **7 skills** with Salesforce domain knowledge
- **Index files** for low-context, selective routing

---

## Quick Start (CLI Bootstrap - Optional)

```bash
# Initialize in your Salesforce project (no install required)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/gellasangameshgupta/sf-compound-engineering-plugin.git sfce init . --ai claude
```

---

## How It Works: Instruction-Based Architecture

Unlike procedural tools that force fixed steps, SF Compound Engineering uses an **instruction-based approach**:

### Commands = Goal + Resources

Commands tell Claude:
- **What** the goal is (plan, implement, review, compound)
- **Where** to find relevant knowledge (index files → agents/skills)
- **What** constraints apply (no code in planning, security requirements)

Claude decides:
- **Which** agents and skills are relevant for THIS specific task
- **Whether** to use WebSearch based on what's needed
- **How** to approach the implementation

### Index Files = Smart Routing

```
agents/index.md  →  "Building a Flow? Read automation/flow-*.md agents"
skills/index.md  →  "Building a Flow? Read flow-patterns and governor-limits skills"
```

---

## The 4 Commands

| Command | Effort | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `/sf-plan` | 40% | Research & design specs (NO CODE) |
| `/sf-work` | 20% | Implement following the plan |
| `/sf-review` | 20% | Review code with relevant agents |
| `/sf-compound` | 20% | Capture learnings to improve future work |

### `/sf-plan` - Design Without Code

```bash
/sf-plan "Lead auto-assignment flow based on territory and workload"
```

What happens:
1. Claude reads `agents/index.md` → finds Flow-related agents
2. Claude reads `skills/index.md` → finds `flow-patterns`, `governor-limits`
3. Claude explores codebase for existing patterns
4. Claude designs the solution (architecture, not code)
5. Output saved to `.specify/specs/<NNN>-<feature>/`

### `/sf-work` - Implement

```bash
/sf-work .specify/specs/001-lead-assignment/plan.md
```

What happens:
1. Claude reads the plan
2. Claude reads relevant skills for patterns
3. Claude follows existing codebase conventions
4. Claude implements and creates tests

### `/sf-review` - Quality Check

```bash
/sf-review
```

What happens:
1. Claude identifies changed files
2. Claude reads relevant agents based on file types
3. Claude reviews using agent checklists
4. Output: findings by severity with fix suggestions

### `/sf-compound` - Capture Learnings

```bash
/sf-compound
```

What happens:
1. Claude analyzes recent work
2. Claude identifies new patterns → adds to skills
3. Claude finds preventable issues → adds checks to agents
4. Claude updates CLAUDE.md with project context

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Initialize
sfce init .                    # Initialize in current directory
sfce init . --ai claude        # Set up for Claude Code (recommended)
sfce init . --force            # Overwrite existing .specify

# Update
sfce update                    # Update all components to latest
sfce update --commands-only    # Only update commands
sfce update --agents-only      # Only update agents
sfce update --skills-only      # Only update skills

# Info
sfce --version
sfce --help
```

---

## Example: Building a Flow

```bash
# 1. Plan the Flow (Claude reads flow-patterns skill automatically)
/sf-plan "Lead auto-assignment flow based on territory and rep workload"

# 2. Implement the Flow
/sf-work .specify/specs/001-lead-assignment/plan.md

# 3. Review (Claude uses automation agents automatically)
/sf-review

# 4. Capture learnings
/sf-compound
```

Because commands are instruction-based, Claude:
- **DOES** read Flow-specific agents and skills
- **DOES NOT** research Apex architecture (not needed for a Flow)
- **DOES NOT** research LWC patterns (not needed for a Flow)

---

## Why Instruction-Based?

### Before (Procedural)
```
Step 1: Call Apex research subagent
Step 2: Call LWC research subagent
Step 3: Call Flow research subagent
... same steps regardless of task
```

### After (Instruction-Based)
```
Goal: Plan this feature
Resources: agents/index.md, skills/index.md
Constraints: No code, save to .specify/specs/
... Claude decides what's relevant
```

**Benefits:**
- No hallucination from irrelevant research
- Faster execution (only reads what's needed)
- Adapts to the actual task

### Context-Efficient Behavior

Commands and indexes are designed for selective reads:
- Start with index files for routing
- Read only relevant agents/skills for the selected classification
- Prefer native Salesforce options first
- Use web research in parallel only when uncertainty is meaningful

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Git (recommended)
- Claude Code (for full support)

---
