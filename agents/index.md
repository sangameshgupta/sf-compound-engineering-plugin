## Routing Map

Use this file as the canonical agent router.

| Classification | Read Section | Avoid |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| AUTOMATION | Flow & Automation | Apex Development, LWC |
| APEX | Apex Development | Flow & Automation |
| LWC | Lightning Web Components | Flow & Automation (unless Apex controller needed) |
| INTEGRATION | Integration | Flow & Automation |
| ARCHITECTURE | Architecture & Data Model | N/A (applies broadly) |

---

## Usage Guidance

1. Confirm classification from the command.
2. Jump to matching section.
3. Read only applicable agent files.
4. For mixed work, apply each agent only to matching files.
