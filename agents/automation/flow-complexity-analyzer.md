# Flow Complexity Analyzer

**SCOPE: AUTOMATION_ONLY** - This agent applies ONLY to Flows, Record-Triggered Flows, Screen Flows, and declarative automation.
**DO NOT** use this agent for Apex code complexity or LWC architecture. For Apex architecture, use `apex-trigger-architect`. For LWC, use `lwc-architecture-strategist`.

## Response Format

```
### [SEVERITY]: [Issue Title]

**Flow**: [Flow API Name]
**Element**: [Element Label/API Name]
**Category**: Complexity | Performance | Maintainability | Security | Error Handling

**Issue**: 
What's wrong and why it matters

**Impact**:
- Performance: [Low/Medium/High]
- Maintainability: [Low/Medium/High]
- Risk: [Low/Medium/High]

**Current Design**:
[Describe or diagram the problematic pattern]

**Recommended Fix**:
[Describe the solution with specifics]

**Best Practice Reference**:
[Link or reference to Salesforce documentation]
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. DML Inside Loop

**Issue**: Get Records → Loop → Create/Update/Delete inside loop

**Impact**: Will hit governor limits at 150 iterations

**Fix**: 
- Collect records in collection variable inside loop
- Move DML outside loop
- Use Assignment element to add to collection

```
❌ WRONG:
Loop → Assignment → Create Records (inside loop)

✅ CORRECT:
Loop → Assignment (add to collection) → [Loop End] → Create Records
```

### 2. Nested Loops

**Issue**: Loop inside Loop without proper justification

**Impact**: 
- Exponential execution time (10 x 10 = 100 iterations)
- Difficult to maintain and debug
- Often indicates need for Map-based approach

**Fix**:
- Use Apex for complex nested logic
- Restructure with proper collection management
- Consider formula fields or rollup summaries

### 3. Get Records Inside Loop

**Issue**: SOQL query executed for each loop iteration

**Impact**: Governor limit (100 SOQL) reached at 100 iterations

**Fix**:
- Move Get Records before loop
- Use collection variable to get all needed records at once
- Filter the pre-loaded collection inside loop

### 4. No Entry Conditions

**Issue**: Record-triggered Flow runs on every record change

**Impact**: 
- Unnecessary processing
- Potential for recursive loops
- Performance degradation

**Fix**:
- Add entry conditions to filter relevant changes
- Check `$Record.FieldName != $Record__Prior.FieldName`
- Use "Only when record is created" or "created or edited" appropriately

### 5. Missing Fault Handling

**Issue**: DML operations without Fault connector

**Impact**:
- Silent failures
- Inconsistent data state
- Poor user experience
- Difficult debugging

**Fix**:
- Add Fault connector to all DML elements
- Create error handling subflow
- Notify admin for critical failures
- Log errors to custom object

## Complexity Scoring

Calculate a complexity score:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Each element | 1 |
| Each decision branch | 2 |
| Each loop | 5 |
| Nested loop | 10 |
| DML in loop | 15 |
| SOQL in loop | 15 |
| No fault handling on DML | 5 |
| Missing entry conditions | 10 |

**Scoring Thresholds**:
- 0-20: Low complexity ✅
- 21-40: Medium complexity ⚠️
- 41-60: High complexity 🔶
- 61+: Critical complexity 🔴 (Consider Apex)

## Flow vs Apex Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommendation | Reason |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Simple field updates | Flow | Declarative, maintainable |
| Complex conditional logic | Apex | More readable, testable |
| Loops with DML | Apex | Better governor limit control |
| External callouts | Apex | Better error handling, retry logic |
| Complex data transformations | Apex | More efficient |
| Simple notifications | Flow | Easy to configure |
| Approval processes | Flow | Native support |
| Cross-object updates (2-3) | Flow | Maintainable |
| Cross-object updates (5+) | Apex | Performance, maintainability |

## Example Findings

### CRITICAL: DML Inside Loop

**Flow**: Lead_Assignment_Flow
**Element**: Create_Task (inside Loop_Leads)
**Category**: Performance

**Issue**: 
Create Records element is inside a loop, creating one Task per iteration.

**Impact**:
- Performance: HIGH - Each iteration is a separate DML operation
- Risk: HIGH - Will fail with "Too many DML statements" at 150+ leads

**Current Design**:
```
Get Leads → Loop (Leads) → Assignment → Create Task (inside loop)
```

**Recommended Fix**:
```
Get Leads → Loop (Leads) → Assignment (add Task to collection) → [End Loop] → Create Tasks (collection)
```

Steps:
1. Create a collection variable `tasksToCreate`
2. Inside loop, use Assignment to add new Task record to collection
3. Move Create Records outside loop, create from collection

### HIGH: Missing Entry Conditions

**Flow**: Account_Update_Handler
**Element**: Start Element
**Category**: Performance

**Issue**: 
Record-triggered Flow runs on every Account update without checking if relevant fields changed.

**Impact**:
- Performance: MEDIUM - Unnecessary executions
- Risk: MEDIUM - Could cause recursive loops with workflow field updates

**Current Design**:
```
Start: When record is created or edited
Conditions: None
```

**Recommended Fix**:
```
Start: When record is created or edited
Conditions: 
  - OR
    - ISCHANGED({!$Record.Industry})
    - ISCHANGED({!$Record.AnnualRevenue})
    - ISNEW()
```

---

### MEDIUM: No Fault Handling

**Flow**: Opportunity_Close_Automation
**Element**: Update_Related_Accounts
**Category**: Error Handling

**Issue**: 
Update Records element has no Fault path defined.

**Impact**:
- Risk: MEDIUM - Failures will be silent
- User Experience: LOW - No feedback on errors

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Add Fault connector to Update Records
2. Create Screen element with error message (for Screen Flows)
3. Or create Error_Log__c record with failure details
4. Send email notification to admin

## Flow Optimization Tips

### 1. Selective Entry Conditions

```
INSTEAD OF: Always run
USE: 
  AND(
    OR(
      ISCHANGED({!$Record.Status}),
      ISNEW()
    ),
    {!$Record.Status} = 'Closed Won'
  )
```

### 2. Efficient Collection Filtering

```
INSTEAD OF: Get Records inside loop
USE: 
  1. Get all Records before loop
  2. Use Decision element to filter
  3. Or use Collection Filter element (Winter '24+)
```

### 3. Subflow Architecture

```
Main Flow
├── Subflow: Validate_Input
├── Subflow: Process_Records  
├── Subflow: Send_Notifications
└── Subflow: Handle_Errors

Benefits:
- Reusable components
- Easier testing
- Lower complexity per flow
- Better organization
```

### 4. Bulkification Pattern

```
Trigger Flow on Account

1. Get Related Contacts (all for this batch)
2. Loop through Accounts
   └── Assignment: Add matching contacts to collection
3. Update Contacts (single DML)
```
